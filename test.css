Looking at the error output in your terminal, I notice several issues:

1. The connection attempts are being retried multiple times and failing:
```
Retrying (Retry(total=2, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None))
Retrying (Retry(total=1, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None))
```

2. The final error suggests the connection pool is being exhausted:
```
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='10.50.66.58', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/completions
```

Let's modify the code to handle these issues:

```python
def call_llm_api(prompt: str) -> dict:
    """
    Call the LLM API with the given prompt
    """
    try:
        # Set up connection with timeout and keep-alive disabled
        conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("10.50.66.58", 8001, timeout=30)
        
        payload = json.dumps({
            "model": "model1",
            "prompt": prompt,
            "max_tokens": 256,
            "min_tokens": 128
        })
        
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Connection': 'close'  # Disable keep-alive
        }
        
        try:
            conn.request("POST", "/v1/completions", payload, headers)
            res = conn.getresponse()
            data = res.read()
            return json.loads(data.decode("utf-8"))
        except Exception as e:
            return {"error": f"API request failed: {str(e)}"}
        finally:
            conn.close()
            
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Connection failed: {str(e)}"}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added a timeout parameter
2. Disabled keep-alive connections
3. Added proper connection cleanup
4. Improved error handling structure

If this still doesn't work, we could also try an alternative approach using the requests library with retry logic:

```python
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

def call_llm_api(prompt: str) -> dict:
    try:
        session = requests.Session()
        retry_strategy = Retry(
            total=3,
            backoff_factor=1,
            status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504, 104]
        )
        adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy)
        session.mount("http://", adapter)
        
        url = "http://10.50.66.58:8001/v1/completions"
        payload = {
            "model": "model1",
            "prompt": prompt,
            "max_tokens": 256,
            "min_tokens": 128
        }
        
        response = session.post(
            url, 
            json=payload, 
            timeout=30,
            headers={'Connection': 'close'}
        )
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": f"Request failed: {str(e)}"}
    finally:
        session.close()
```

Also, please check:
1. Is the server rate-limiting requests?
2. Are there any firewall rules that might be dropping persistent connections?
3. Is the server configured to handle concurrent connections properly?

Would you like to try either of these approaches?
