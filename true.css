   b. If a workload exceeds the predefined threshold (e.g., >12 hours):
      - An alert is generated and sent to the responsible person
      - Alert includes workload details, current runtime, and estimated cost
      - Options are provided for managing the long-running workload

8. User Management of Resources:
   a. Users can access the provisioning portal to manage their resources
   b. Options include stopping, resuming, or deleting resources
   c. System provides recommendations for cost optimization

9. Automated Resource Cleanup:
   a. System identifies idle or underutilized resources
   b. Based on policies, resources are either deallocated or users are prompted for action
   c. Deleted resources are logged, and associated costs are reconciled
