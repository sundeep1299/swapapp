This invention addresses the inefficiencies and limitations in traditional deployment processes for ephemeral (dynamic) workloads, particularly in AI/ML environments. The system introduces a "No Code Provisioning" approach that streamlines the dynamic workload deployment process, eliminating dependencies on external code repositories. This solution enables concurrent deployment of dynamic workloads without resource queuing, resulting in significantly faster deploymentâ€”up to 5 times faster than traditional methods. The invention provides unlimited scaling capabilities, allowing organizations to deploy workloads at any scale without performance degradation. It efficiently manages steady state, spill over, and spike workloads through an orchestration layer, leveraging a combination of long-term reservations (CUD) and dynamic workload scheduling (DWS) in cloud environments. This approach optimizes cost-effectiveness for AI/ML compute resources, addressing the challenges of obtaining on-demand high-performance GPUs from public cloud vendors. Overall, this system revolutionizes the deployment process for ephemeral workloads by making it more efficient, scalable, and independent of external dependencies.
