# Detailed Description of the Invention

## 1. System Architecture

The "No Code Provisioning" system for deploying ephemeral workloads comprises a multi-layered architecture designed to efficiently manage and deploy resources in a cloud environment. The key components of the system architecture are as follows:

a. ML Users Interface: The topmost layer where users interact with the system, typically through an enterprise portal.

b. ML Platform Offerings: This layer presents the available machine learning tools and resources to the users.

c. Backend API Layer: Serves as an intermediary between the user interface and the underlying infrastructure, handling requests and responses.

d. Dynamic Terraform No-Code Workspaces: This layer dynamically creates and manages Terraform workspaces for each workload, eliminating the need for static code repositories.

e. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): The cloud infrastructure where the actual compute resources are provisioned and managed.

## 2. Components of the Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer, referred to as the Lumi orchestration layer, is a critical component of the system. It consists of the following elements:

a. AiDa Portal: The user-facing interface for submitting requests and managing resources.

b. Request Processor: Handles incoming requests from the AiDa Portal, performing initial processing and validation.

c. Queue Processor: Manages the queue of processed requests, ensuring efficient handling of multiple concurrent requests.

d. TFE (Terraform Enterprise): Interfaces with the Dynamic Terraform No-Code Workspaces to provision and manage cloud resources.

e. GCP (Google Cloud Platform): The ultimate destination for resource provisioning and management.

f. Visualization Dashboard: Provides real-time insights into resource utilization, status, and other relevant metrics.

## 3. Queuing Mechanism

The queuing mechanism is designed to efficiently handle multiple requests and ensure optimal resource allocation. The process works as follows:

a. User requests are received through the AiDa Portal and processed by the Request Processor.

b. Processed requests are placed in a queue managed by the Queue Processor.

c. The Queue Processor prioritizes and schedules requests based on various factors such as user entitlements, resource availability, and system load.

d. Requests are then forwarded to the TFE for resource provisioning in a controlled, efficient manner.

## 4. Workload Processing Flow

The workload processing flow encompasses the entire lifecycle of a resource request:

a. User Login: The user logs into the Enterprise portal and selects a project they have access to.

b. Compute Requirement Submission: The user submits their compute requirements (e.g., Dataproc/notebook/GCE).

c. Orchestration Layer Validation: The system validates user entitlements and performs various checks, including budget validation.

d. Request Processing: If all validations pass, the request is processed and entered into the orchestration layer database with a status of REQUESTED.

e. Resource Creation: The system initiates the creation of workload-specific ephemeral Terraform workspaces and provisions the requested resources in Google Cloud.

f. Status Updates: The resource status in the orchestration layer database is updated through the stages of PENDING, CREATING, and finally RUNNING.

g. User Access: Once resources are created, users can access their Jupyter notebooks or other provisioned resources.

h. Resource Management: Users can choose to stop compute resources for later use or delete them entirely through the provisioning portal.

## 5. Integration with GCP

The system integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud Platform:

a. Resource Provisioning: Utilizes GCP's APIs and services to create and manage cloud resources dynamically.

b. Terraform Integration: Leverages Terraform's GCP provider to define and provision infrastructure as code.

c. Monitoring and Logging: Integrates with GCP's monitoring and logging services for comprehensive oversight of provisioned resources.

d. Identity and Access Management: Utilizes GCP's IAM for secure access control and resource management.

## 6. Optimization Techniques for Ephemeral Workloads

The system employs several techniques to optimize the management of ephemeral workloads:

a. Dynamic Workspace Creation: Creates Terraform workspaces on-demand, reducing overhead and improving resource utilization.

b. Automated Lifecycle Management: Tracks resource states and manages the complete lifecycle of ephemeral resources, from creation to deletion.

c. Intelligent Scheduling: The Queue Processor optimizes request handling to maximize resource utilization and minimize wait times.

d. Cost Optimization: Implements budget checks and provides cost-effective resource recommendations.

e. Automated Alerts: Sends notifications for long-running clusters and resources stuck in termination states, preventing unnecessary resource consumption.

f. Flexible Resource Control: Allows users to easily stop and resume workloads, optimizing resource usage and costs.

g. Concurrent Deployments: Enables faster (5x) deployment compared to traditional methods by allowing multiple workloads to be provisioned simultaneously.

h. Scalability: Supports unlimited scaling to accommodate varying workload demands without performance degradation.

This comprehensive system provides a streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective solution for managing ephemeral workloads in enterprise cloud environments, particularly suited for AI/ML applications that require dynamic resource allocation and management.
