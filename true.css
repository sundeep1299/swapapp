# Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a system and method for optimized provisioning of ephemeral workloads in enterprise cloud environments, specifically addressing the limitations of traditional deployment processes. At its core, this invention introduces a "No Code Provisioning" approach that revolutionizes the way dynamic workloads, particularly in AI/ML environments, are deployed and managed.

Key features of the invention include:

1. Multi-Layered Architecture: The system comprises multiple layers including an ML Users interface, ML Platform Offerings, Backend API Layer, Dynamic Terraform No-Code Workspaces, and integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. Orchestration Layer: A sophisticated orchestration layer (Lumi) manages the entire deployment process, handling user requests, validations, and resource allocation efficiently.

3. Dynamic Terraform Workspaces: The system creates workload-specific Terraform workspaces dynamically, eliminating dependency on static code repositories like GitHub.

4. Accelerated Deployment: The "No Code Provisioning" approach enables deployment speeds up to 5 times faster than conventional methods.

5. Unlimited Scaling: The architecture supports unlimited scaling of resources without performance degradation.

6. Automated Workflow: The process includes user authentication, project selection, compute requirement submission, multi-stage validations, and automated resource provisioning.

7. Resource State Management: The system tracks resource states (REQUESTED, PENDING, CREATING, RUNNING) and manages the lifecycle of ephemeral resources.

8. Intelligent Monitoring: Incorporates features like budget checks, long-running cluster notifications, and automated alerts for resource management.

9. User-Friendly Interface: Provides easy access to Jupyter notebooks and a visualization dashboard for monitoring and managing resources.

10. Flexible Resource Control: Users can stop compute resources for later use or delete them entirely through the provisioning portal.

This invention offers several advantages over existing technologies:

- Improved Efficiency: By streamlining the deployment process and eliminating bottlenecks associated with traditional Terraform and GitHub workflows.
- Enhanced Flexibility: The dynamic nature of the system allows it to adapt quickly to changing workload requirements, crucial for modern cloud-native and AI/ML applications.
- Cost Optimization: Through automated budget checks and resource state management, the system can substantially reduce cloud computing costs for enterprises.
- Simplified Management: The "No Code" approach reduces complexity and minimizes the need for specialized expertise in infrastructure management.
- Increased Reliability: By reducing dependencies on external systems and incorporating multiple validation layers.

In summary, this invention provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of deploying and managing ephemeral workloads in enterprise cloud environments. By addressing the inefficiencies of traditional methods, it enables organizations to fully leverage the power and flexibility of cloud computing for their dynamic AI/ML workload needs.
