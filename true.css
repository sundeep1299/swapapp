 The error you're encountering is due to a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue. Your React application, running on localhost:8080, is trying to make a request to https://lumiqcpauto-dev.aexp.com, which is not allowed due to the browser's same-origin policy.

To resolve this, you need to either:

1. Configure the server to allow CORS requests from your local development environment, or
2. Use a proxy in your development environment to bypass the CORS restriction.

Since you likely don't have control over the server configuration, let's use a proxy approach. Here's how to modify your code:

1. First, update your `package.json` to include a proxy configuration:

```json
{
  ...
  "proxy": "https://lumiqcpauto-dev.aexp.com"
}
```

2. Then, update your `fetchResources` function in `ProjectSelection.js`:

```javascript
const fetchResources = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  setError(null);
  try {
    const userId = user?.attributes?.adsid || 'vsing379';
    const response = await fetch(`/terraform/automate/data_proc/${userId}`, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        // Add any other necessary headers, like Authorization if required
      },
      credentials: 'include' // This might be necessary depending on your auth setup
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    setResources(data);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Error fetching resources:', e);
    setError('Failed to fetch resources. Please try again.');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

Key changes:
1. The fetch URL now uses a relative path (`/terraform/automate/data_proc/${userId}`) instead of the full URL.
2. Added `credentials: 'include'` to the fetch options, which might be necessary if the API requires cookies for authentication.

3. Make sure your development server is running with this new proxy configuration. You might need to restart your development server for the changes to take effect.

4. If you're using Create React App, you might need to run your development server with HTTPS:

```
HTTPS=true npm start
```

These changes should allow your local development environment to make requests to the API without CORS issues. The proxy will forward requests from your local server to the actual API server.

If you're still encountering issues, it might be due to authentication requirements or other server-side configurations. In that case, you may need to consult with your backend team to ensure that the API is correctly set up to accept requests from your development environment.
