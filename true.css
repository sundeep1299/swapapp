 The error message at the bottom of the image indicates:

"ERROR in [eslint] src\components\pages\Services.js Line 164:13: Parsing error: Unexpected token (164:13)"

This suggests there's a syntax error on line 164, column 13 of your Services.js file. The ESLint parser encountered an unexpected token, which usually means there's a typo or a misplaced character in your code.

Looking at the code in the image, I can see a potential issue:

```jsx
{currentItems.map((service) => {
  const config = parseConfig(service.config || '');
  return (
    <tr key={service.id}>
      <td>{service.id || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{service.name || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{service.type || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{service.createdBy || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{service.status || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{service.createdAt ? new Date(service.createdAt).toLocaleString() : 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{service.updatedAt ? new Date(service.updatedAt).toLocaleString() : 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{config.project_id || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{config.region || 'N/A'}</td>
      <td>{config.zone || 'N/A'}</td>
    </tr>
  );
})}
```

The closing parenthesis and curly brace at the end of this map function seem to be on separate lines. They should be together, like this:

```jsx
})}
```

Make sure this closing part is on a single line, and check for any other misplaced brackets or parentheses in your code. If this doesn't resolve the issue, the error might be on a different line than what's visible in the image. In that case, you'd need to check line 164 of your Services.js file for any syntax errors.
