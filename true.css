 Based on the App.js code shown in the image, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The Router component is missing. You need to wrap your entire app with BrowserRouter.

2. The Routes component is missing. You should wrap your Route components with Routes.

3. The AuthBlueSso component is not properly closed.

Here's how you should modify your App.js:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import './App.css';
import Logo from './assets/lumiclear.png';
import FooterLogo from './assets/lumilogo.png';
import { AuthBlueSso } from './components/AuthBlue/AuthBlueSso';
import UserInfo from './components/UserInfo';
import NavBar from './components/NavBar';
import Home from './components/Home';
import ProjectSelection from './components/ProjectSelection';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <AuthBlueSso>
        <div className="App">
          <header>
            <div className="leftheader"><img src={Logo} alt="Lumi OneConsole" className="logo" />OneConsole</div>
            <div className="middleheader"></div>
            <div className="rightheader"><UserInfo /></div>
            <NavBar />
          </header>
          <main>
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
              <Route path="/gcp-resources" element={<ProjectSelection />} />
            </Routes>
          </main>
          <footer>
            <img src={FooterLogo} alt="Lumi OneConsole" className="footerlogo" />
            <p>Anything you want to add </p>
          </footer>
        </div>
      </AuthBlueSso>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Key changes:

1. Wrapped the entire app with `<Router>` component.
2. Wrapped the `<Route>` components with `<Routes>`.
3. Properly closed the `<AuthBlueSso>` component.
4. Moved `<NavBar />` inside the header, as it seems to be part of your header layout.
5. Removed `<h1>GCP Resources</h1>` and `<ProjectSelection />` from the main content, as they will be rendered by the router when needed.

These changes should resolve the routing errors you were experiencing. Make sure to save the file and restart your development server if necessary. If you're still encountering issues, please check your package.json to ensure you have the correct version of react-router-dom installed (it should be version 6.x for this setup to work correctly).
