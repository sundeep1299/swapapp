 Based on the information provided in the image, I'll create a method outline and explain how to write it:

```java
@PostMapping("/admin/tfe/appoint-leader/{job-name}")
public Mono<String> updateLockAdsId(@RequestHeader @ApiParam(hidden = true) String requestHeader,
                                    @PathVariable("job-name") String jobName) throws InvalidParamException, ApiException {
    // Method implementation
}
```

Here's how to write this method:

1. Method signature:
   - Use `@PostMapping` annotation with the path "/admin/tfe/appoint-leader/{job-name}" as specified in the image.
   - Return type is `Mono<String>` as indicated in the image.
   - Method name is `updateLockAdsId` (from the image).
   - Parameters:
     - `requestHeader`: Annotated with `@RequestHeader` and `@ApiParam(hidden = true)`.
     - `jobName`: Annotated with `@PathVariable("job-name")` to capture the job name from the URL.
   - Throws `InvalidParamException` and `ApiException` as mentioned in the image.

2. Method implementation:
   - Check if the input `jobName` exists in the job_config table.
   - Determine whether to update or insert based on existing data.
   - Update the lock_ads_user_id column in the job_config table with the HOSTNAME of the pod.
   - Use a where clause with job_nm and modl_nm (job_nm from input, modl_nm is fixed as "tfe-automation").

3. Error handling:
   - Implement proper error handling for the mentioned response codes (200, 400, 500).
   - Return appropriate responses based on the operation's success or failure.

4. Return value:
   - Return a `Mono<String>` containing the response message (e.g., "successfully upserted the hostname of pod").

Remember to add necessary imports and ensure that your implementation adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices for reactive programming with Spring WebFlux (as implied by the use of Mono).
