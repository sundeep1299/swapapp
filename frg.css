 The issue with the useEffect hook in your code is that you're not handling the case where the response is not OK correctly. The condition for throwing an error is inverted. Here's the problematic part:

```javascript
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}
```

This condition will throw an error when the response is OK, which is the opposite of what you want. To fix this, you should change it to:

```javascript
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}
```

Also, make sure that you're properly catching and handling this error in your try-catch block.

Here's how the corrected useEffect should look:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchServices = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://lumigcpauto-dev.aexp.com/admin/resources', {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          'Accept': 'application/json',
        },
        credentials: 'include'
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      setServices(data);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Error fetching services:', e);
      setError('Failed to fetch services. Please try again.');
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchServices();
}, []);
```

This correction should resolve the issue with your useEffect hook. It will now properly handle successful responses and throw errors for unsuccessful ones.
