 Ah, I understand now! Let's modify the `extract_prc_groups` function to only grab the first PRC group mentioned in the members array:

```python
def extract_prc_groups(response_data):
    """Extract PRC groups from the API response"""
    try:
        # Navigate through the nested structure
        results = response_data.get('results', {})
        for result in results:
            policy = result.get('policy', {})
            bindings = policy.get('bindings', [])
            
            for binding in bindings:
                members = binding.get('members', [])
                # Look for the first PRC group in members
                for member in members:
                    if member.lower().startswith(('group:prc-', 'GROUP:prc-')):
                        group_name = member.split(':', 1)[1] if ':' in member else member
                        # Return immediately after finding the first PRC group
                        return [group_name]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error extracting PRC groups: {str(e)}")
    
    return []  # Return empty list if no PRC group found
```

Key changes:
1. Removed the set since we only want the first occurrence
2. Return immediately when we find the first PRC group in any members array
3. No need for flags or multiple breaks - just return the first match

This will now return only the first PRC group it finds in the members array, ignoring any subsequent PRC groups. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
