To create a database server connection in pgAdmin and then create a table on Windows, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install pgAdmin and PostgreSQL

1. Download and install PostgreSQL from the official site (https://www.postgresql.org/download/).


2. During the installation, ensure that pgAdmin is selected to be installed.


3. Finish the installation and make note of the PostgreSQL username (default: postgres) and password.



Step 2: Open pgAdmin

1. Launch pgAdmin from your Start menu.


2. When pgAdmin opens, you may need to enter the password you set during PostgreSQL installation.



Step 3: Connect to a Server

1. In the pgAdmin interface, right-click on Servers in the left pane and select Create > Server.


2. In the Create - Server window:

General tab:

Name your server (e.g., Local PostgreSQL).


Connection tab:

Hostname/address: localhost (for a local server).

Port: 5432 (default for PostgreSQL).

Maintenance database: postgres.

Username: postgres (or the one you set during installation).

Password: Enter the password you set during the PostgreSQL installation.


Click Save.




Step 4: Create a Database

1. In the left pane, expand your server, then right-click on Databases and select Create > Database.


2. In the Create - Database window:

Name: Enter a name for your database (e.g., my_database).

Click Save.




Step 5: Create a Table

1. After creating the database, expand Databases > your_database > Schemas > public.


2. Right-click on Tables and select Create > Table.


3. In the Create - Table window:

General tab:

Enter the Name of your table (e.g., employees).


Columns tab:

Click the + sign to add columns.

Enter the column name (e.g., id, name), data type (e.g., integer, text), and any other details like Primary Key for the ID column.


Once done, click Save.




Step 6: Verify Table Creation

1. Expand Tables under your database to see your newly created table.


2. You can also run SQL queries to verify the table by right-clicking the table and selecting Query Tool, then using a query like:

SELECT * FROM employees;



This will display your table data.
