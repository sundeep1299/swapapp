I'll help you convert this Postman request into Python code that you can run locally. The code will make the same API request to the specified endpoint.



```python
import requests
import json

# API endpoint
url = "http://10.50.66.58:8081/v1/completions"

# Request headers
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'User-Agent': 'PostmanRuntime/7.30.0',
    'Accept': '*/*',
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive'
}

# Request body
payload = {
    "model": "model1",
    "prompt": "generate C code for linked lists?",
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "min_tokens": 120
}

try:
    # Make the POST request
    response = requests.post(
        url, 
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    
    # Print the response
    print(response.text)
    
    # Check if request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("\nRequest successful!")
    else:
        print(f"\nRequest failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
        
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

A few notes about this code:

1. Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. I've included the same headers as shown in your Postman request, though some of them (like User-Agent) might not be strictly necessary.

3. The payload matches exactly what you had in the Postman body.

4. I've added basic error handling and status code checking.

5. The code will print the full response text, just like you would see in Postman.

You can run this script locally, and it will make the same request to your local endpoint at `10.50.66.58:8081`. Make sure the server is running and accessible at that address before running the script.

Would you like me to modify anything about this code or add any additional functionality?
