Algorithm Design:
Resource Evaluation: For each payload request, evaluate whether the required resources are available on the Nvidia NCP.
Stacking Payloads: If resources are available, schedule the payload immediately. If not, place the payload in a waiting queue.
Dynamic Rescheduling: As resources become available or as payloads complete, check the waiting queue to see which payload can now be scheduled. Reevaluate the order based on resource matching.
Backfilling: If a high-resource payload is waiting, you might consider running smaller, lower-resource payloads in the meantime to maximize resource utilization.
