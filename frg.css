 Ah, I see the new error. You're getting an AttributeError because the SimpleRAG object has no attribute 'vector_store'. Looking at your code, you need to initialize the vector_store in your SimpleRAG class's __init__ method.

Here's how to fix it:

```python
def __init__(self, embedding_api_url: str, llm_api_url: str):
    self.embedding_api_url = embedding_api_url
    self.llm_api_url = llm_api_url
    self.prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["context", "query"],
        template="""
        Context information: {context}
        
        User question: {query}
        
        Please provide an accurate answer based on the context information above.
        If the context doesn't contain relevant information, please say so.
        """
    )
    # Initialize the vector store
    self.vector_store = []  # Add this line
```

The error occurs because you're trying to use self.vector_store.append() in your code, but vector_store was never initialized as an attribute of the SimpleRAG class. Adding the initialization in the __init__ method should resolve the AttributeError.

Also, make sure that any time you create a new SimpleRAG instance, you're properly initializing it with the required URLs:

```python
rag = SimpleRAG(
    embedding_api_url="your_embedding_api_endpoint",
    llm_api_url="your_llm_api_endpoint"
)
```

This should resolve the AttributeError you're seeing.
