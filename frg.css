Ah, I understand! You want potential security-related questions that could arise during implementation. Here are key questions categorized by focus areas:

1. **PII & Data Security Questions**
- How do we detect if prompts contain AXP customer data?
- What validation checks are needed when processing employee data in prompts?
- How do we handle scenarios where users accidentally input card numbers?
- What mechanisms should be in place to detect and redact SSNs in responses?
- How do we handle historical chat logs containing potential PII?

2. **NLP & Query Security**
- How do we prevent prompt injection attacks in RAG systems?
- What controls are needed for queries accessing internal knowledge bases?
- How do we validate that retrieval results don't contain sensitive data?
- What mechanisms prevent queries from accessing unauthorized data domains?
- How do we handle cross-referencing attacks in RAG implementations?

3. **Storage Related**
- What's the secure approach for storing embeddings with sensitive data?
- How do we implement the 30-day retention policy for chat histories?
- What encryption standards apply to vector database storage?
- How do we secure temporary caches during query processing?
- What controls are needed for storing fine-tuning datasets?

4. **Model Security**
- How do we validate open-source models against security standards?
- What controls are needed for custom model training data?
- How do we prevent model output from revealing sensitive information?
- What security measures are needed for model weights storage?
- How do we implement secure model deployment pipelines?

5. **Access Control**
- How do we implement role-based access for different LLM capabilities?
- What authentication is required for RAG system access?
- How do we manage API keys securely across environments?
- What controls are needed for third-party LLM service access?
- How do we implement the principle of least privilege?

6. **Compliance & Audit**
- How do we track and audit all LLM interactions?
- What logging is required to meet TECH05.01 standards?
- How do we demonstrate compliance with security standards?
- What metrics should we monitor for security purposes?
- How do we handle security incident response?

7. **Content Safety**
- How do we prevent generation of harmful content?
- What filters are needed for output validation?
- How do we handle bias detection in responses?
- What controls prevent unauthorized code generation?
- How do we implement content safety for RAG responses?

8. **Integration Security**
- How do we secure API endpoints per TECH06.35?
- What network security controls are needed per TECH08.11?
- How do we implement secure communication between components?
- What controls are needed for external service integration?
- How do we handle secrets management?

Would you like me to:
1. Generate more specific questions for any category?
2. Focus on questions for a particular implementation type?
3. Add technical implementation considerations to any questions?
4. Create questions for specific security scenarios?
